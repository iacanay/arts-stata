### How do I get set up? ###

 Download files in working directory, and run the following command before implementing:
 
  . capture program drop art

 The file "art_example.do" illustrates the implementation for some 
 results in Canay, Romano & Shaikh (2017) on the dataset from 
 Angrist and Lavy (2009). The dataset is contained in "base01.dta". 
 The file "art_tutorial.pdf" also provides a brief tutorial on the 
 implementation of the command. For further help type:

 . help art

### Who do I talk to? ###
